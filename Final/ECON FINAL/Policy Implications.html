				<h3>Moving to Opportunities Program</h3>

         
           <p>the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) initiated a program in the late 1990s with the aim of measuring the benefits of neighborhood choice and economic mobility, by manipulating placements in subsided or government sponsored housing. This program, called <i>Moving to Opportunity </i> followed the participants over a span of ten years in order to determine the effects of moving out of neighborhood poverty. The research surveyed a control group of families that were placed in subsidized housing in neighborhoods similar to their own levels of poverty and an experimental group placed in neighborhoods with less than 10% of poverty. This longitudinal and cross-sectional study performed across a variety of metropolitan cities reaped Initial findings demonstrating physical and mental health benefits for those who were placed in less improvised neighborhoods. <sup>1</sup> However, no immediate evidence was observed to determine any favorable increase in economic outcomes for the experimental group. 
           <br>
           
           <br>
        MTO results found gender differences for how children may have perceived this move to greater opportunity. Male children in the experimental group were more likely than those in the control group to participate in risky behavior. Female children in the experimental were less likely to engage in violent and risky behavior, as well as less likely to exhibit psychological distress or anxiety. Though, there were no immediate gains in the occupational or educational outcomes for the individuals in the experimental group, it created a discussion of whether or not a simple move can overturn some of the impacts that poverty has on early development <sup>2</sup> For more information about the Moving to Opportunities Experiment, please click <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/publications/pdf/mtofhd_fullreport_v2.pdf"> here. </a>

            <h3>Subsidized Housing Projects</h3>
            
            <p>Neighborhood sorting isn’t just a result of social preferences, but also a result of economic factors, as well. It is no secret that the housing market assigns greater value to spaces that are optimal, meaning that the best areas are likely to cost more, leaving the poor to compete for less substantial areas.  Due to less competition in these less desired neighborhoods, it is easier for local governments to build subsidized public housing units or “project-based housing” in areas with cheap land cost, further separating the poor from the rich and congregating the poor into confined spaces. Subsidized project-based housing, often referred to as Housing projects, or just “the projects” refers to government funded housing establishments that cater to those who have low-income.<sup>4</sup> (POSSIBLE GOOGLE MAPS)</p>

			Though, like most socialized welfare programs, subsidized project-based housing has been met with many criticisms. Because these housing projects often lack the funding for proper upkeep and maintenance, these developments sometimes become beds for crime, health concerns, and poverty. Housing projects often are associated with a wide variety of stigma across many metropolitan areas. Cities like NYC, Chicago and Los Angeles, saw the most backlash towards the development of housing projects, with people challenging that these establishments only further promote racial segregation and isolate the poor from well-needed opportunities. Media representations also contribute to negative representation of these improvised areas, furthering these negative stereotypes.

            <h3>Subsidized Housing Vouchers</h3>

            <hr>
           <p>One of the largest forms of Tenant Based Rental Assistance is HUD’s <i>Housing Choice voucher Program, </i> otherwise known as “Section 8”. Under the Housing Choice Voucher Program, low-income households receive a voucher through their local public housing authority. A voucher represents a direct payment from the housing authority to the landlord for all or a portion of a tenant’s monthly rent. A key aspect of the Housing Choice Voucher Program is the “portable” nature of a voucher, which allows voucher holders to use their vouchers in any area they might choose--promoting diversity with respect to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, and allowing access to a wider range of jobs, schools, and services than they would have without a voucher. 
           <br>
           <br>
           While the vouchers seek to prevent homelessness and eviction for low income citizens, agencies find that the vouchers are often met with some rejection. A study done at NYU Furman Center found that only a portion of tenants with vouchers are actually able to use them. <sup>5</sup> This is mostly due to source of income discrimination from landlords and real estate brokers who refuse to house individuals because of their government subsidies. Often times, source of income discrimination is reinforced from negative stereotypes about those who may be receiving public assistance. Source of income discrimination limits voucher holders in where they can find housing. Often, people who have rental assistance vouchers might find themselves once again returning to improvised or substandard neighborhoods, further isolating them from economic opportunities outside of low-income areas.

            Subsidized Housing Vouchers, Programs, and initiatives are useful mechanism the government enforces to address the impacts of income inequality and residential segregation.  The vast differences in the neighborhood qualities between the rich and the poor only further exacerbate the already exhausting cycle of intergenerational poverty. The deprivation of resources and opportunities for those who have no other choice but to reside in improvised neighborhood provides a barrier for upward mobility. These barriers include social and educational inequality, racial segregation, and lack of access to resources for jobs and health care. In order to address inequality on a national scale, it may be beneficial to consider its effects on a local level.
